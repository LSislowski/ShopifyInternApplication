Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16i38oonuX1y1g7C_UAmiK9GkY7cS-64DfiDMNiR41LM/edit#gid=0">click here</a> to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?</b>

~~~
When we are looking at the calculation for the Mean of sales amounts, this is an inaccurate value to use since the distribution of the sales amounts are right skewed.  Looking through the exploratory Jupyter Notebook, we can see that the largest buyer of shoes spent over $11mm over the 30 day window.  This drastically affected the Average Order Value.  The Median Order Value (MOV) in this instance is $284 which seems to be a more accurate value to describe what types of purchases are generally being made for shoes in this dataset.
